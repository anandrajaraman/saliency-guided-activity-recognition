TODO:

- Fix BGR or RGB
- Preprocess UCF101 dataset
- Test saliency generator with UCF101 data
- Generate UCF101 dataset for activity prediction
- Implement CNN and LSTM in pytorch with pretrained weights from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4389.pdf


Low Priority
- Visualize features out of the discriminator networks penultimate layers
- Use discriminator networks weights for the CNN layer between saliency generator
